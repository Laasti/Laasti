# Laasti
A PHP Framework based on PHP League and Symfony components. Laasti is finnish for Mortar. 

Laasti aims to make full use of composer packages to built a development-ready framework. Bringing carefully chosen packages together!

No closure are encouraged, you won't even see them in the docs. Everything is in a class.

A stack of middlewares to deal with the request

I believe that there shouldn't be any HTML/JS/CSS in PHP classes. PHP should only provide data. The views deal with the data. That way there is only one place to look for HTML: the theme.

## Create your first controller

## Display a template view

## Add data to the view from the controller

## Display a paginated list: https://github.com/Kilte/pagination

## Display a form

## Validate a form

## Submit a form

## Display a menu

## Add a third-party library

## Debug with logs

## Send an email

## Upload a file

## Localize

## Manage sessions

## Add cronjobs
